    <h2>Welcome to Full Pantry</h2>
    <p>We fight hunger by connecting food donors with people in need.
        Every day, good food is wasted while people go hungry. We bridge this gap by rescuing surplus food and delivering it directly to families in need. Together, we're turning compassion into action and waste into hope—one meal at a time
    </p>
    <p>Homepage Content After Welcome:

"Across our city, perfectly good food is discarded daily while children go to bed hungry and parents skip meals to feed their families. This painful reality is why Full Pantry exists.

We rescue fresh, nutritious food that would otherwise be wasted—from supermarkets, restaurants, and farms—and deliver it directly to families struggling with food insecurity.

Each meal we provide represents more than just nourishment; it's dignity restored, hope renewed, and a community saying, 'We care about you.'

Join us in creating a city where no one has to choose between paying bills and putting food on the table. Because hunger isn't just a statistic—it's our neighbor, our classmate, our community member. And together, we can make sure everyone has enough to eat."</p>
