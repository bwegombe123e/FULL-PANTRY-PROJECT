    <h2>About Our Mission</h2>
    <h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Full Pantry began when we noticed food waste in our community while many struggled with hunger. WeFull Pantry began when students noticed food being wasted while families struggled with hunger. We created a simple solution: collecting surplus food from stores and restaurants and distributing it to those in need. What started as a campus project has grown into a community movement, proving that small actions can create big change in the fight against hunger. created a bridge between surplus and need.
it was so sad  to see people and children suffering all the time  and so we decided to do something about it
